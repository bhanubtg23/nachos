---Halt system calls:
Just call the interrupt stop function.

-----Exit system call:
Following the suggestions made during the lab session, we have confirmed the following:
If the calling process has children, zombify them. for the process
If the also has parents, remove them from that parent's list of children.
PCBManager then removes her PCB in the process from its list. Then the process
Frees the page it had and its PID. finally the process wakes up
Other processes wait for it and call the thread:

finished.

-----Exec syscall.
First, the function tries to get the executable.
specified path. If successful, updates the address space of the current process
have actionable information. This includes updating the PC register.
Start at the beginning of the new executable code.

----Join system call:
If the process you want to join is a child process of the caller, the parent process
It just waits for the child board's condition variable. as soon as the baby comes out
The waiting parent wakes up and continues walking.

-----Fork system call:
Here we save and clone the registers of the current process
its address space. Then create a new thread and a new circuit board for the new process. or
After receiving a new PID, a new PCB is added to the PCBManager. This is also added
A list of children of the calling process. Finally the new thread runs a dummy
A function to call after restoring the new process registration to the machine
Machine running function.

-----Kill system call:
If the PID is the same as the caller, execute the terminating syscall code. If the process you kill has child processes, they become zombies. process
It is also deleted from the parent-child list. The exit status is then set on the circuit board.
The pages and PIDs used by the process are then freed. Finally, all waiting threads are awakened and
The thread is marked for destruction and the scheduler finds the next thread.
process to run. 

------Yield() system call:
Call the thread yield function.
